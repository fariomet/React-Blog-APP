📰 React Blog App — JSON Placeholder API Project

## 📖 Project Overview
The React Blog App is a simple yet powerful blog interface built using React.js.  
It dynamically fetches posts from the public JSON Placeholder API, simulating a real-world blogging platform.

This project demonstrates understanding of:
- Fetching and displaying API data in React
- Managing state with hooks
- Rendering lists dynamically
- Building reusable components
- Adding extra features such as search, loading states, and error handling


### ✅ Core Features
- Fetches posts from JSONPlaceholder API:  
  `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- Displays a list of blog posts dynamically.
- Each post includes a title and a brief excerpt (body text).
- Fully functional navigation between pages.

### 🌟 Bonus Features
- **Search bar:** Quickly find posts by title keywords.
- **Loading state:** Displays a loading message or spinner while fetching posts.
- **Error handling:** Shows a user-friendly message if the API fails.
- **Responsive design:** Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Reusable components:** Posts are rendered using a `BlogCard` component.


## 🧠 Learning Objectives
This project helped practice and understand:
- The concept of **React components** and **props**
- Using **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Performing **API requests** using `fetch()`
- Mapping and rendering dynamic data
- Managing conditional rendering for loading and error states
